# At this point the image is done and what remains below are the runtime configuration used by the user to configure
# the container that will be created out of the image. Namely the user can override some environment variables with
#   docker run -e "var1=val1" -e "var2=val2" ...
# The supported environment variables that can be overridden are:
# - DB_USER: the name of the user configured for XWiki in the DB. Default is "xwiki". This is used to configure
#            xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
# - DB_PASSWORD: the password for the user configured for XWiki in the DB. Default is "xwiki". This is used to
#                configure xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
# - DB_DATABASE: the name of the database to use. Default is "xwiki". This is used to configure xwiki's
#                hibernate.cfg.xml file.
# - DB_HOST: The name of the host (or docker container) containing the database. Default is "db". This is used to
#            configure xwiki's hibernate.cfg.xml file.
# - CONTEXT_PATH: The name of the context path under which XWiki will be deployed in Tomcat. If not specified then it'll
#                 be deployed as ROOT.

# Example:
#   docker run -it -e "DB_USER=xwiki" -e "DB_PASSWORD=xwiki" <imagename>

# Starts XWiki by starting Tomcat. All options passed to "docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]"
# are also passed to docker-entrypoint.sh. If "xwiki" is passed then XWiki will be configured the first time the
# container executes and Tomcat will be started. If some other parameter is passed then it'll be executed to comply
# with best practices defined at https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#consistency.
