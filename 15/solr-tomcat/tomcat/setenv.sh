# We're making the following changes to the default:
# * Adding more memory (default is 512MB which is not enough for XWiki)
# * By default, Tomcat does not allow the usage of encoded slash '%2F' and backslash '%5C' in URLs, as noted in
#   https://tomcat.apache.org/security-6.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_6.0.10. We want to allow for them as it's useful to
#   be able to have '/' and '' in wiki page names.
# * On some system /dev/random is slow to init leading to a slow Tomcat and thus Xwiki startup.

# Users can override these values by setting the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. For example:
# -e JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx2048m"

XMX="-Xmx1024m"
ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH="-Dorg.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true"
ALLOW_BACKSLASH="-Dorg.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH=true"
SECURERANDOM="-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom"

  if [[ ! $JAVA_OPTS =~ .*-Xmx[0-9]+.* ]]; then
