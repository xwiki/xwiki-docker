    <!-- Please refer to the installation guide on
         https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/ for configuring your
         database. You'll need to do 2 things:
         1) Copy your database driver JAR in WEB-INF/lib or in some shared lib directory
         2) Uncomment the properties below for your specific DB (and comment the default
            database configuration if it doesn't match your DB)
    -->

    <!-- Generic parameters common to all Databases -->

    <property name="show_sql">false</property>
    <property name="use_outer_join">true</property>

    <!-- Without it, some queries fail in MS SQL. XWiki doesn't need scrollable result sets, anyway. -->
    <property name="jdbc.use_scrollable_resultset">false</property>

    <!-- DBCP Connection Pooling configuration. Only some properties are shown. All available properties can be found
         at https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/configuration.html
    -->
    <property name="dbcp.defaultAutoCommit">false</property>
    <property name="dbcp.maxTotal">50</property>
    <property name="dbcp.maxIdle">5</property>
    <property name="dbcp.maxWaitMillis">30000</property>
    <property name="connection.provider_class">com.xpn.xwiki.store.DBCPConnectionProvider</property>

    <!-- Setting "dbcp.poolPreparedStatements" to true and "dbcp.maxOpenPreparedStatements" will tell DBCP to cache
         Prepared Statements (it's off by default). Note that for backward compatibility the "dbcp.ps.maxActive" is also
         supported and when set it'll set "dbcp.poolPreparedStatements" to true and "dbcp.maxOpenPreparedStatements" to
         value of "dbcp.ps.maxActive".

         Note 1: When using HSQLDB for example, it's important to NOT cache prepared statements because HSQLDB
         Prepared Statements (PS) contain the schema on which they were initially created and thus when switching
         schema if the same PS is reused it'll execute on the wrong schema! Since HSQLDB does internally cache
         prepared statement there's no performance loss by not caching Prepared Statements at the DBCP level.
         See https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-1740.
         Thus we recommend not turning on this configuration for HSQLDB unless you know what you're doing :)

         Note 2: The same applies to PostGreSQL.

           - "jdbc.use_streams_for_binary" needs to be set to "false",
             see https://community.jboss.org/wiki/HibernateCoreMigrationGuide36
           - "xwiki.virtual_mode" can be set to either "schema" or "database". Note that currently the database mode
             doesn't support database creation (see https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-8753)
           - if you want the main wiki database to be different than "xwiki" (or "public" in schema mode)
             you will also have to set the property xwiki.db in xwiki.cfg file
